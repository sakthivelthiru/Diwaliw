                                            Why we eat sweet during the diwali celebration??<br><br><img src="sweet.jpg">
                                            celebration is complete without food, and Diwali is all about sweets. While savory snacks have their place, sweets, called mithai, have special significance. They represent purity, joy, the sweetness of life, and good luck for the future. Sweets serve as offerings in religious rituals, but they aren't just for the gods.
